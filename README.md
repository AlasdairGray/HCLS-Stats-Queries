# Dataset Descriptions: HCLS Community Profile

This repository contains a copy of the queries given in [Section 6.6](https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/#s6_6) of the [Dataset Descriptions: HCLS Community Profile](https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/). The queries can be used to compute the statistical metrics that the profile reports.

The queries have been copied in from [IDP-KG](https://github.com/AlasdairGray/IDP-KG/commit/321f02dc19912f95c0f311ea851764c28e9b6902) where they were originally transcribed from the W3C Note.

## REST API
